Code is currently a prototype only.
Classes that are unused have descriptions in brackets, such as "(unused)" or "(console)".
The "dist" folder contains the JAR files needed to run the program.
Ensure that "RandomPicker.jar" is next to the lib folder containing "AbsoluteLayout.jar".
Ensure that the "resources" folder is next to "RandomPicker.jar", otherwise, a new folder will be created and previously saved classes will not be accessible.
In short, do not modify the contents of the "dist" folder. Renaming the "dist" folder should be fine.
