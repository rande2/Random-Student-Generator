Code is currently a prototype only. The most recent version is in source(final version).  
Classes that are unused have descriptions in brackets, such as "(unused)" or "(console)".  
Ensure that the "resources" folder is next to "RandomPicker.jar", otherwise, a new folder will be created and previously saved classes will not be accessible.
